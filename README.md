## About

Hi, I'm Mario! I am a professional in data and business management with over 2 years of extensive experience in operations and project development. My logic driven thinking and my growth mindset have been sharpened through my Business School education and my post-diplomas in Data Analytics. My multidisciplinary
background, combined with energy and motivation, allow me to efficiently tackle challenging projects. I am equipped with excellent communication skills in three languages, high work ethics, and a strong sense of leadership. 

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
